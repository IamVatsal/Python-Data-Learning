# NumPy and Pandas Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing NumPy and Pandas, two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It serves as a personal learning space where I explore concepts, implement examples, and build projects related to data science and numerical computing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

   For additional dependencies (if any), check the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

Navigate through the folders to find examples and exercises. Each folder may contain Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, or datasets demonstrating various concepts.

- `numpy_basics/`: Fundamental NumPy operations
- `pandas_basics/`: Introduction to Pandas DataFrames and Series
- `data_analysis/`: Practical data analysis examples
- `projects/`: Mini-projects applying NumPy and Pandas

Run the scripts or notebooks to see the code in action.
